    title: "Software & Graphic Design Hackathons", 
    fullDescription: "I have actively participated in multiple hackathons, including a Blockchain Hackathon where my team built a blockchain-based software solution, ultimately emerging as the winners. Additionally, I have taken part in several graphic design hackathons at SwahiliPot Mombasa, Red Cross, and other venues, further refining my design and creative problem-solving skills. Beyond hackathons, I have worked extensively as a freelance graphic designer, creating logos, posters, banners, business cards, and stickers for various clients. My experience spans multiple industries, allowing me to craft unique and visually compelling designs that align with brand identities. Currently, I am engaged in graphic design work for Ridgeways Pentecostal Church, where I contribute to their branding and visual communication. My passion for design and technology continues to drive me toward innovative and impactful creative solutions.",
